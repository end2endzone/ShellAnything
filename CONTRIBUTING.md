# Contributing to ShellAnything

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.



## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.



## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and follow [coding styles](#use-a-consistent-coding-style).
6. Issue that pull request!



## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.



## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/end2endzone/ShellAnything/issues)
We encourage you to write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. If you have found a problem, fill out a [Bug Report](https://github.com/end2endzone/ShellAnything/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=bug) which help clarify your bug description and your expectations. If you are not sure about your problem, you can also [open a generic issue](https://github.com/end2endzone/ShellAnything/issues/new); it's that easy! 

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce, be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.



## Use a consistent Coding Style
This project uses [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming) for naming functions, classes, types and objects.
Not all the code was ported to the new coding style but new code should follow this coding style.

[cpplint](https://github.com/google/styleguide/tree/gh-pages/cpplint) can be used to validate code formatting. It is a python based coding style checker for C/C++. You can install with `pip install cpplint`. Then you can just use `cpplint file.cpp` or `cpplint --recursive .` (including the last `.` character)
